Description: Internet Routing Daemon
 BIRD is an Internet routing daemon with full support for all the major
 routing protocols. It allows redistribution between protocols with a
 powerful route filtering syntax and an easy-to-use configuration
 interface.
 .
 BIRD supports IPv4 and IPv6 versions of OSPF, RIP, BGP and Babel routing
 protocols. It also supports supplementary protocols like BFD, RPKI-Router
 and IPv6 router advertisements.
